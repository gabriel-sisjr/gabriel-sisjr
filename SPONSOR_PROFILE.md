# ☕ Supporting My Open Source Journey

Hey there! 👋 I'm **Gabriel Santana**, a full-stack developer with 9+ years of experience turning coffee into code. 

I've spent my career working with various technologies - from .NET to NodeJS, Docker to AWS, and more recently diving deep into React Native. I'm passionate about architecture, design patterns, microservices, and building software that actually works (preferably without breaking at 2 AM).

## About Me

I'm someone who:
- ☕ **Drinks a lot of coffee** - Seriously, like *a lot*. This isn't a joke. My code runs on caffeine.
- 🏗️ **Loves architecture** - Give me a good design pattern and I'm happy for days
- 🔧 **Builds solutions** - I focus on creating tools that solve real problems for real developers
- 📚 **Believes in documentation** - Good code deserves good docs (and vice versa)
- 🌍 **Values open source** - I believe knowledge should be accessible to everyone

Currently, I'm maintaining projects like **react-native-background-location** and other open source tools that help developers build better mobile applications.

## Why Sponsor Me?

Every sponsorship helps me:

- ☕ **Keep coding** - More coffee = more code. It's simple math really.
- 🐛 **Fix things faster** - Bugs don't wait for business hours, and neither do I (with coffee, of course)
- 🚀 **Build new projects** - I have ideas. Lots of ideas. Coffee helps turn them into reality.
- 📚 **Improve documentation** - Because nothing is worse than code without docs (except decaf coffee)
- 🎯 **Focus on open source** - More time for open source = more tools for everyone

## The Coffee Math 🧮

- **$5/month** = About 2 coffees → Keeps me awake during morning commits ☕☕
- **$10/month** = 4 coffees → Sustains me through a full feature development ☕☕☕☕
- **$25/month** = 10 coffees → Powers an entire iOS implementation sprint (with espresso shots) ☕☕☕☕☕☕☕☕☕☕

*Disclaimer: Coffee math assumes standard coffee prices. If you're buying Starbucks, adjust calculations accordingly. I prefer local roasters, but I'm not picky when it comes to sponsorship coffee!*

## What You Get

As a sponsor, you're not just buying me coffee (though I appreciate that!). You're:

- 🎯 **Supporting a developer** - Me! A real person who codes (a lot)
- 🚀 **Helping me build more** - Your support gives me time to create better open source tools
- 🐛 **Priority support** - Need help? I'll respond faster (probably with coffee in hand)
- 💬 **Direct access** - Want to chat about code, architecture, or just life? I'm here!
- 📢 **Public recognition** - You deserve it! I'll make sure everyone knows you're awesome
- ☕ **Caffeinating the process** - Better coffee = better code. It's science.

## My Work Philosophy

I believe that:
- **Code should be clean** - Like a good espresso, quality matters
- **Documentation is essential** - Untested code is like decaf coffee: technically coffee, but why?
- **Open source should be accessible** - Everyone should be able to use and learn
- **Caffeine is a tool** - Not a crutch (okay, maybe a crutch, but a useful one!)

## What I'm Working On

Beyond my current projects, I'm always exploring:
- 🏗️ Architecture patterns and best practices
- 🔧 New technologies and frameworks
- 📱 Mobile development (especially React Native)
- ☁️ Cloud infrastructure and DevOps
- ☕ Finding the perfect coffee-to-code ratio

*Each new project requires approximately 3-5 coffees to start, and countless more to finish. Your sponsorship helps keep the beans flowing.*

## Can't Sponsor? No Problem!

Even if you can't sponsor financially, you can still help:

- ⭐ **Star my repos** - Free and makes my day!
- 🐛 **Report bugs** - Help me make things better
- 💻 **Contribute code** - PRs are always welcome!
- 📖 **Improve docs** - Help others (and me) understand the code
- 💬 **Share my work** - Tell your friends! Spread the word about open source!

## Coffee Philosophy ☕

Here's what I've learned in 9+ years of coding:
- **Coffee fuels code** - It's not just a drink, it's a lifestyle
- **Open source helps everyone** - When we share knowledge, everyone wins
- **Quality matters** - Good code is like good coffee: worth the extra effort
- **Community is important** - Developers helping developers makes us all better

## Thank You! 🙏

Whether you sponsor, star, contribute, or just use my work - thank you! You're helping a developer keep building, keep learning, and keep sharing with the community.

And remember: **Every sponsorship is basically a cup of coffee that helps me stay awake to write better code for everyone.** 

So really, you're not just supporting code. You're supporting a developer who loves what they do, loves sharing it with others, and really, *really* appreciates your support (and the coffee!).

**P.S.** - If you sponsor at $25+/month and you're ever in my area, I'll literally buy you coffee. Consider it a caffeinated thank you. ☕❤️
